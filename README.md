## Baselayer 3

v.3.4.0 • 22 KB (minified) • MIT licence.

Designed as a good place to start, Baselayer may be all you need — for small web projects. Or you may use it as a _baselayer_ to quick-start your mega project.

Ready to use as-is, Baselayer gives you all this and more:

* A modern CSS reset
* Foundational accessibility features
* Container-responsive typography and spacing
* Container query responsive layouts using grid and flexbox
* Styled form elements and buttons
* A lightweight system of utility classes for controlling dimensions, positioning, spacing, borders, text, images, and colors
* A color system based on `color-mix( in OKLCH)` shades for for text, borders, and backgrounds
* Built-in dark mode (requires a simple JavaScript theme toggler — example provided)
* Control of many of these things using CSS variables (custom properties)

Baselayer uses modern CSS technologies such as `grid`, functions (e.g. `clamp()`, `color-mix()`, `light-dark()`), `var()` custom properties, and CSS class nesting. Therefore it supports only [Basline: widely available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) (mid-2023 forward) web browsers such as Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.
