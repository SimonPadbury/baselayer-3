## Baselayer 3

Modern starter CSS library with OKLCH color utilities, CSS math functions, CSS grid, and CSS variables.

v.1.1.1

Designed as a good place to start, Baselayer may be all you need â€” for small web projects. Or you may use it as a _baselayer_ to quick-start your mega project.

Ready to use as-is, Baselayer gives you all this and more:

* A modern CSS reset
* Foundational accessibility features
* Responsive typography
* Simple responsive layouts using grid, flexbox, dimensions, and positioning
* A lightweight system of utility classes for controlling spacing, borders, text, images, and colors
* Styled form elements and buttons
* A OKLCH color scale system of utilities for text, borders, and backgrounds
* Built-in dark mode (requires a JavaScript theme toggler)
* Control of many of these things using CSS variables (a.k.a. custom properties)

Baselayer uses some modern web technologies such as CSS Grid, CSS math functions (e.g. clamp), CSS variables, CSS cascade layers, and the OKLCH color model. Therefore it supports only up-to-date (2023 forward) evergreen web browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.).
