# Baselayer 3

v.3.4.7 • 24 KB (minified) • MIT licence.

Designed as a good place to start, Baselayer may be all you need — for small web projects. Or you may use it as a _baselayer_ to quick-start your mega project.

Ready to use as-is, Baselayer gives you all this:

* A modern CSS reset
* Minimalist styled classless typographic, and form elements
* Reliable accessibility features for assistive technology users
* A lightweight system of utility classes for controlling dimensions, positioning, spacing, borders, text, and images
* `@container` query responsive layout utilities using CSS grid and flexbox
* Responsive typography, layout, and spacing using `clamp()` ramps
* A compact color lightnesssystem based on `color-mix(in OKLCH)` for text, borders, and backgrounds
* Built-in dark mode using `light-dark()`
* Theming control using CSS variables
* And more

Baselayer uses modern CSS technologies such as `grid`, functions (e.g. `clamp()`, `color-mix()`, `light-dark()`), `var()` custom properties, and CSS class nesting. Therefore it supports only [Basline: widely available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) (mid-2023 forward) web browsers such as Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.
