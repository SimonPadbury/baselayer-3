## Baselayer 3

v.1.2.2

A modern starter CSS library with container queries, a real CSS grid system, clamp() powered typography and spacing sizes, OKLCH color utilities, and custom properties.

Designed as a good place to start, Baselayer may be all you need — for small web projects. Or you may use it as a _baselayer_ to quick-start your mega project.

Ready to use as-is, Baselayer gives you all this and more:

* A modern CSS reset
* Foundational accessibility features
* A lightweight system of utility classes for controlling dimensions, positioning, spacing, borders, text, images, and colors
* Container-responsive typography and spacing
* Container query responsive layouts using grid and flexbox
* Styled form elements and buttons
* A OKLCH color scale system of utilities for text, borders, and backgrounds
* Built-in dark mode (requires a simple JavaScript theme toggler — example provided)
* Control of many of these things using CSS variables (a.k.a. custom properties)

Baselayer uses some modern web technologies such as CSS Grid, CSS math functions (e.g. clamp), CSS variables, CSS cascade layers, and the OKLCH color model. Therefore it supports only up-to-date (2023 forward) evergreen web browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.).

> If you would rather use media queries for these utility classes, or if you need to support older (pre-container query) browsers a while longer, this is easy to do: in `layout.css` simply do a search-and-replace `@container → @media` (and then you don’t need to use the Baselayer’s `container` context class).
